# Access Llama-3 LLM
  - We have tried to access Llama-3 the 7 Billion model using 2 ways namely through Google Colab & on Local PC
## On Google Colab:
 - To be able to access/use Llama-3 on Colab, first thing you would need is Meta/Llama-3 repository access on Hugging Face
(https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B)
 - Fill a basic form & raise access, it might take couple of days
 - Create a token on Hugging Face & save the same as HF_TOKEN under colab secrets
 - Use the Notebook to talk to Llama-3 7B model

 ## On Local PC:
  - To be able to access/use Llama-3 on Colab, first thing you would need is Meta/Llama-3 repository access on Hugging Face
 (https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B)
 - Fill a basic form & raise access, it might take couple of days
 - You would need ollama open-source framework (https://ollama.com/)
 - Install ollama, & use basic commands to talk to Llama-3 7B model
 - I have 8 GB DD3 RAM on my Laptop, hence I faced latency, but having GPU would be smooth like Ice Cream
